Lab Instructions - EC2 Instance Connect to Public Instance
*** PLEASE WATCH THE VIDEOS FIRST AND THEN USE THESE INSTRUCTIONS TO COMPLETE THE LAB ***

*** EC2 Instance Connect - LAB INSTRUCTIONS ***

EC2 Instance Connect simplifies the process of connecting to EC2 instances by eliminating the need for managing and sharing SSH keys.

Let's look at how to use EC2 Instance Connect

Prerequisites:

1. Download and install the latest version of AWS CLI:

    https://aws.amazon.com/cli/   

2. Windows Client   

   a. Install OpenSSH Client

   - OpenSSH is an optional feature in Windows.

   - Follow the steps in the below link to install only the openssh client. The steps also show how to install openssh-server. However, we don't need server component.

   https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse?tabs=gui#install-openssh-for-windows

   

   b. Install PowerShell AWS Tool Plugin

   - Open PowerShell CLI as an admin

   - Run this command

     Install-Module -Name AWS.Tools.Common

     

   Reference: https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/AWS.Tools.Common/4.1.361

     

3. Linux and MacOS Client

   a. SSH tool is pre-installed in Linux and MacOS

   b. Install jq package (required for parsing AWS IP ranges used by various services) 

    - Amazon Linux, run the command

        sudo yum install jq -y

       

    - MacOS, run the command

        brew install jq       



Objectives of Lab:

-> Learn how to:

    - connect to a public instance using EC2 Instance Connect

    - how to use browser based login

    - how to connect using SSH

    - tighten security controls



Steps - Quick Start:

-> Login as myadmin user

-> Create a new security group Instance-SSH-SG

    - Allow SSH access from anywhere (we will tighten this later)   

-> Launch a new EC2 instance

    - Name: Public Instance

    - Amazon Linux 2 AMI

    - No Keypairs

    - Default VPC

    - Public IP Enable

    - Attach Instance-SSH-SG

   

-> Login from Web console

    - Open detail page for your public EC2 instance

    - Click Connect

    - Choose EC2 Instance Connect

        - Connect using EC2 Instance Connect

    - You are now connected to a public EC2 instance!

       

-> CLI - Login using Single click EC2 Instance connect Option

    - You can login to the instance using SSH

    - Specify your instance id and region

    aws ec2-instance-connect ssh --instance-id i-0171b237b08d44d4f --profile myadmin --region us-west-2

   

-> CLI - Show Behind the scenes Action   

    -> Generate key pair

     ssh-keygen -t rsa -f my_key

   

    -> Push Public key to the instance using Instance Connect

   

    Linux and MacOS:

    aws ec2-instance-connect send-ssh-public-key \
    --region us-west-2 \
    --instance-id i-0f1743e0feecb57d0 \
    --instance-os-user ec2-user \
    --ssh-public-key file://my_key.pub \
    --profile myadmin
   

    Windows:

    aws ec2-instance-connect send-ssh-public-key ^
    --region us-west-2 ^
    --instance-id i-0780c3044e807f3de ^
    --instance-os-user ec2-user ^
    --ssh-public-key file://my_key.pub ^
    --profile myadmin
   

    -> Connect to the instace within 60 seconds and work for as long as needed. change the IP address

      ssh -i my_key ec2-user@34.219.114.44

   

    -> need to connect within 60 seconds. temporary key access is removed after 60 seconds

   

    -> Verify that you cannot login after 60 seconds - you need to push the public key again to login to the instance

   

Steps - Tighten Security Group:

-> Allow SSH access from only from specific IP Address

    -> Change inbound SSH rule to allow access only from your ip address

-> Test Browser based login

    -> Connection fails

    -> This is because browser based login uses Instance Connect Public Endpoint IP as the source to connect to your public instance

    -> We need to fix the security group

-> Test CLI based login

    -> Connected and works!

    -> CLI connects to the public instance using your IP address as the source

-> Let's fix the browser based connection issue

    -> We need to allow Instance connect service public IP range for that region

    -> We can query from command line   

    - Windows PowerShell

        - Start Powershell console

        - update region         

        Get-AWSPublicIpAddressRange -Region us-west-2 -ServiceKey EC2_INSTANCE_CONNECT | select IpPrefix                   

    - Linux/MacOS       

        - update region         

        curl -s https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json| jq -r '.prefixes[] | select(.region=="us-west-2") | select(.service=="EC2_INSTANCE_CONNECT") | .ip_prefix'

     Reference: https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/ec2-instance-connect-troubleshooting 

    - The above command returns:

        3.16.146.0/29 for us-east-2                 

        18.237.140.160/29 for us-west-2

         

    - Update SG to allow SSH access from Instance Connect Service Public IP Range for the region

        - Add SSH rule from the above IP range   

    - Now try to connect from browser based connect

        - Connection succeeds!

Summary:

-> We looked at how to connect to a public instance using temporary keypairs

-> Multiple options:

    -> browser based

    -> CLI single click option

    -> CLI traditional tools access

-> We also tightened SG rules

    -> Allows connection from CLI and Browser-based connection

    -> Allows access only from specific IP ranges   

-> Further limit access using IAM based access control

    -> Public Instance access is allowed for users who have these IAM privileges

    -> ec2-instance-connect:SendSSHPublicKey action

    -> ec2:DescribeInstances action

    -> For finegrained access control, you can also add condition to check for tags or specific instance ids
